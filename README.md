# **Privacy Protector: Anti-Screen Watching & Remote Access Blocker**  

A Python script that **prevents screen watching, remote access, and unauthorized monitoring** by detecting screen recording software, disabling screenshots, and blocking suspicious connections in real time.  

## **🔧 Features**  

### ✅ **Detects & Closes Screen Recording Apps**  
- Scans running processes for known screen recording software (e.g., OBS, Bandicam, CamStudio).  
- Automatically terminates detected screen recorders.  

### 🛑 **Disables Screenshots (PrintScreen Key)**  
- Prevents taking screenshots using the PrintScreen key to protect sensitive content.  

### 🔍 **Checks for Remote Desktop & VNC Connections**  
- Scans for active remote access on common ports (RDP, VNC, TeamViewer).  
- Alerts the user and blocks repeated attempts.  

### 🔒 **Blurs the Screen if Suspicious Activity is Detected**  
- If a screen recording app is found, the screen is blurred using OpenCV to prevent data leaks.  

### ⚠️ **Detects Suspicious Windows (e.g., Snipping Tool, OBS, Screen Recorder)**  
- Monitors active windows for known screen capture tools and alerts the user.  

### 🔄 **Runs in a Loop, Checking Every 5 Seconds**  
- Continuously monitors and protects against unauthorized screen access.

## **📦 Requirements**  

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:  

- `psutil` → Process monitoring & termination  
- `numpy` → Image processing support for OpenCV  
- `opencv-python` (`cv2`) → Used for blurring the screen  
- `pyautogui` → Controls mouse movement & clicking  
- `pywin32` → Interacts with Windows APIs to detect open windows and disable screenshots  

### **Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:  

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **🚀 How to Use**  

1. **Run the script** in Python:  
   ```sh
   python prevent.py
   ```
2. It will **automatically disable screenshots** and start monitoring.  
3. If a **screen recording app or remote access** is detected:  
   - The application will be closed.  
   - The screen will be blurred for privacy.  
4. To stop the script, **press `CTRL + C`**:  
   - The PrintScreen function will be restored before exiting.
